# Quik

Quik is a very simple parsing engine for python. It's primary usage is for writing blogs, articles, websites, etc. It is LaTeX-like, in the sense that it does *not* follow a tree structure. At the moment, Quik supports only HTML output.

## Getting Started

I recommend downloading Quik as a git submodule, however, you are free to do as you wish.

### Prerequisites

You only need python. This was designed for python 2, but I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work on python3.

### Installing

If you do decide to use Quik as a git submodule, it's as easy as:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/markovejnovic/Quik.git
```

in your project directory.
